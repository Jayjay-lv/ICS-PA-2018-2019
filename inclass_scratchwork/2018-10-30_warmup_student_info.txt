Write a program that asks the user if they want to know your name, graduation year, or favorite food, then tells the user the requested piece of information.

If you finish with that, add an extra behavior for when they ask for something invalid, like your shoe size.

If you finish that, add more options for them to ask about, like your pet's name, your favorite class, and your deepest fear.
