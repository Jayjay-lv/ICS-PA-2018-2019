# Warmup: Write a program that asks a trivia question (e.g. "What's the capital of Vermont?") and asks the user for the answer. If they get it right, congratulate them. If not... well, tell them it was a good try?

# Step Two: Use a while loop to keep asking them to try again until they get it right.

# Step Three: Give them a limited number of chances to get it right before telling them the answer.

# "Is x not equal to 5"
x != 5
not x == 5
