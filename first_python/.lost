Oh, here are the instructions. Phew!


Some Setup Before the Fun Stuff
-------------------------------

We'll need to set up a couple things first, like telling your computer that you want to run Python 3 instead of Python 2. We can do this part with the .bash_profile file in your home folder.

First, open a shell and go to your home directory.
Check if there's a file called .bash_profile in that directory. If there isn't, run this command:

  $ touch .bash_profile

This will create an empty file called .bash_profile in that directory.
Now open that file in Sublime Text and add these three lines to the bottom of the file:

  PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:${PATH}"
  export PATH
  alias subl="/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"

Save that file and close it, then run this command:

  $ source .bash_profile

Now try running this command to open .bash_profile again:

  $ subl .bash_profile

Oh wow. That's pretty exciting, right?

Now create a new file called "what_happened.txt", and in it, answer two questions:
1. How did you suddenly gain this new superpower to open things with Sublime Text so easily?
2. How could you allow yourself to open files in Sublime Text with the command "$ superpower filename.txt"?


Some Actual Programming
-----------------------

Okay, so first I need you to make a new file called "my_first_script.py". In it, write a script that does the following:
1. Introduces itself with a message saying who wrote the script (that's you).
2. Asks the user for their name.
3. Greets the user in some kind of friendly way.
4. Asks the user for their height in imperial units.
5. Converts their height to centimeters.

Test this program by running it. There's more than one way to run a Python script, but not all of them may do what you want!


Submission
----------

Put what_happened.txt and my_first_script.py in a new directory called "2018-09-14_First_Python". Compress this file with the following command:

  $ zip (firstname_lastname) 2018-09-14_First_Python/*

Obviously, replace "firstname_lastname" with your first name and last name, e.g. "Clark_Kent".

This should create a file called firstname_lastname.zip that you should submit online.


Evaluation
----------

If you complete all of the instructions above, and submit your zipped file, you'll be considered proficient in the basics of writing your own Python scripts.

If you want to achieve mastery, complete one of the following:

1. Capitalize the user's name for them if they didn't bother to do it on their own.
2. When your script asks for the user's height, ask for first their feet and then their inches.
3. Prevent your script from crashing if you don't get a number from the user for their height.
4. Accept decimal values for their height.

Include an additional file in your 2018-09-14_First_Python directory (before zipping it) called mastery.txt, explaining which of these options you chose to implement.
